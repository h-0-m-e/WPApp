# WPApp - Wallpaper Application!
This is a simple wallpapers app, made to pass the test to employment.

## What it is?
#### It is an app, what can help u to set new wallpaper to your phone. It uses photos from unsplash.com, sorted and, obviously, shorted.

## What about tech stack?
#### Here I used:
- MVVM
- Single-Activity
- Coroutines
- Flow
- ROOM
- Retrofit (and OkHttp3, obviously)
- Material Design (2)
- All my time and perseverance :)


UPD: Gradle does not let me build an artifact, so I can't upload it here :(
